> A rhythm game from absolute scratch in C (if I stop procrastinating)

This is my attempt at making anything that resembles a game from absolute scratch, doing everything myself, from memory management to windowing to graphics to audio. Honestly knowing myself I don't think it's gonna go anywhere since I procrastinate a lot, but maybe this time I'll go somewhere.

I'll keep [notes](/notes.md) about my experience coding it as I go.

## Status

I barely have the start of a platform layer. This is gonna take a while.
